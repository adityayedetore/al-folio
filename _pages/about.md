I'm a junior undergraduate student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu), studying Cognitive Science and Computer Science. 

I do research under [Tal Linzen](http://tallinzen.net) studying what deep learning models can tell us about language acquisition. 

In addition, I do research under [Justin Halberda](https://pbs.jhu.edu/directory/justin-halberda/) studying our processing of visual scenes.
